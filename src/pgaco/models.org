* List of models
** Basic Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
** Elite-ACO
** MinMax-ACO
** Policy Gradient ACO (PGACO)
  - In the run on a random 100 node, fully connected graph with a clear
     shortest path, the parameters need to be, roughtly: pheromone evaporation
     ~ 0.1, learning rate > 10, with 10 ants (this was tested and performance seems to do down with more ants. The ideal is ~10)
  - There is a question on what to use for in gradient, reward/rolling reward,
     advantage, quality function
*** TODO
    These are items I still need to try to implement
  - [ ] minmax
  - [ ] playback
  - [ ] temperature on learning rate
